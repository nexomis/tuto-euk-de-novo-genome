# Comparative (Phylo)genomics

In this chapter, we will explore comparative genomics to gain insights into the evolutionary relationships and conserved elements among different fungal genomes. We will use tools like PHAST for conservation analysis and OrthoFinder for identifying orthologous gene families.

## Environment Setup

### Software Dependencies

We will use several tools for this analysis. Here's how to set them up using containers.

#### Apptainer / Docker

``` bash
# For PHAST tools
alias phyloFit="apptainer run docker://quay.io/comparative-genomics-toolkit/cactus:v2.9.9 phyloFit"
alias phyloP="apptainer run docker://quay.io/comparative-genomics-toolkit/cactus:v2.9.9 phyloP"
alias phastCons="apptainer run docker://quay.io/comparative-genomics-toolkit/cactus:v2.9.9 phastCons"

# For OrthoFinder
alias orthofinder="apptainer run docker://quay.io/biocontainers/orthofinder:3.1.0--hdfd78af_0 orthofinder"
```

### Conda

You can also create a conda environment with the necessary tools.

``` bash
conda create -n compgenomics -c bioconda phast orthofinder
conda activate compgenomics
```

## Generating a Neutral Model with phyloFit

Before running `phastCons` or `phyloP`, we need a phylogenetic model of neutral evolution. This model, typically in a `.mod` file, can be generated using `phyloFit`, a tool from the PHAST package.

`phyloFit` requires a tree topology. This tree can be derived from: - The phylogenetic tree generated during the scaffolding step (e.g., from JolyTree in chapter 06). - A known species tree from taxonomic databases.

Here is an example of how to run `phyloFit` with a given tree and alignment:

``` bash
# We can use the tree from the scaffolding chapter
# The MAF file also comes from the scaffolding chapter
export TREE="((ME23,(ZUM2407,(V032g,Fo47))),tuto482);"
export MAF_FILE="06-scaffolding/cactus/alignment.maf"

echo "$TREE" > tree.nwk

# The tree needs to be in Newick format, e.g., "((sp1,sp2),sp3);"
# Let's assume we have a file `tree.nwk` with the tree.
phyloFit --tree tree.nwk --subst-mod REV --out-root neutral_model ${MAF_FILE}
```

This will generate `neutral_model.mod`, which we can use in the next steps.

## Predicting Conserved Elements with PHAST

PHAST (PHylogenetic Analysis with Space/Time models) is a software package for comparative and evolutionary genomics. It includes tools for predicting conserved elements and measuring evolutionary conservation.

### phastCons

`phastCons` is used to predict conserved elements from a multiple alignment. It uses a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM) to identify segments of a genome that are likely to be under negative selection.

For more details, refer to the [phastCons tutorial](http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/phastCons-tutorial.php).

We can use the Multiple Alignment Format (MAF) file generated during the scaffolding step in chapter `06-scaffolding.qmd` and the neutral model we just created.

``` bash
# Path to the MAF file from chapter 06
export MAF_FILE="06-scaffolding/cactus/alignment.maf"
export NEUTRAL_MODEL="neutral_model.mod"

# Run phastCons
phastCons --target-coverage 0.3 --expected-length 45 $MAF_FILE $NEUTRAL_MODEL --most-cons-regions cons.bed --score
```

### phyloP

`phyloP` computes conservation or acceleration p-values based on a phylogenetic model. It can be used to identify specific sites that have evolved more slowly or more quickly than expected under a neutral model.

For more details, see the [phyloP tutorial](http://compgen.cshl.edu/phast/phyloP-tutorial.php).

#### Example 1: Run phyloP with CONACC mode and LRT method

This example demonstrates how to run `phyloP` with an alignment and our neutral model file using the CONACC (CONservation/ACCeleration) mode and the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) method.

``` bash
# Using the MAF file and the neutral model
export MAF_FILE="06-scaffolding/cactus/alignment.maf"
export NEUTRAL_MODEL="neutral_model.mod"

phyloP --mode CONACC --method LRT --wig-scores $NEUTRAL_MODEL $MAF_FILE > phyloP_scores.wig
```

#### Branch/Subtree Approaches

`phyloP` also supports analyzing specific branches or subtrees in the phylogenetic tree. This is useful for identifying lineage-specific conservation or acceleration. You can specify a subtree of interest using the `--subtree` option.

## Finding Orthologs with OrthoFinder

OrthoFinder is a fast, accurate, and scalable tool for inferring orthogroups, orthologs, and gene trees. It is widely used for comparative genomics studies.

For a detailed guide, refer to the [OrthoFinder tutorial](https://davidemms.github.io/orthofinder_tutorials/running-an-example-orthofinder-analysis.html).

### Data Preparation

We need to gather the proteome files for the species we want to compare. For this analysis, we will use the proteomes of four *Fusarium* species and the one we annotated with BRAKER. It is a good practice to use only the longest transcript variant per gene to avoid inflating gene counts and improve accuracy.

``` bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes
mkdir -p 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/primary_transcripts

# Download proteomes
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/013/085/055/GCF_013085055.1_ASM1308505v1/GCF_013085055.1_ASM1308505v1_protein.faa.gz -O 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/Fo47.faa.gz
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/048/165/035/GCA_048165035.1_ASM4816503v1/GCA_048165035.1_ASM4816503v1_protein.faa.gz -O 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/ZUM2407.faa.gz
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/048/164/945/GCA_048164945.1_ASM4816494v1/GCA_048164945.1_ASM4816494v1_protein.faa.gz -O 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/V032g.faa.gz
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/030/719/095/GCA_030719095.1_ASM3071909v1/GCA_030719095.1_ASM3071909v1_protein.faa.gz -O 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/ME23.faa.gz

# Decompress files
gunzip 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/*.gz

# Copy our annotated proteome
# Assuming the proteome from BRAKER (prot+rna) is the one to use
cp 09-annot/prot_rna/braker.aa 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/our_strain.faa

# Download the script to select the longest transcript
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder/master/tools/primary_transcript.py -O 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/primary_transcript.py
chmod +x 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/primary_transcript.py

# Run the script on each proteome file
for f in 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/*.faa; do
    python 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/primary_transcript.py $f
done

# Move the resulting primary transcript files to a dedicated directory
mv 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/proteomes/*_primary_transcript.fa 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/primary_transcripts/
```

### Running OrthoFinder

Once the primary transcript files are ready, we can run OrthoFinder.

``` bash
orthofinder -f 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/primary_transcripts/ -o 11-comparative-genomics/orthofinder/results/
```

OrthoFinder will create a results directory containing orthogroups, gene trees, and a species tree.

## Downstream Analysis of Orthologs

The orthogroups identified by OrthoFinder can be used for various downstream analyses to study gene evolution and function.

### Phylogenetic Analysis

-   **Use introns for robust phylogenies**: For closely related species, introns can be used to build robust phylogenies as they are often less constrained by selection than coding sequences (neutral evolution).
-   **Align CDS with MACSE / T-Coffee**: Align the coding sequences (CDS) of single-copy orthologs. MACSE is particularly useful as it aligns sequences based on their amino acid translation, which helps in maintaining the reading frame. T-Coffee can also be used, driven by the protein alignment to guide the CDS alignment.

### Evolutionary Analysis with HyPhy and PAML

-   **HyPhy (Hypothesis Testing using Phylogenies)**: Use the aligned CDS to test various evolutionary hypotheses, such as identifying sites under positive selection.
-   **PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood)**: Another powerful package for phylogenetic analysis of DNA or protein sequences. It can be used to estimate synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) to infer selective pressures.

These analyses can provide deep insights into the evolutionary dynamics of gene families and help in understanding the functional diversification of species.
