# Genome Annotation with BRAKER

In this chapter, we will perform genome annotation using BRAKER, a powerful pipeline for fully automated gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes. We will use the assembly of *Fusarium oxysporum* f. sp. *lycopersici* strain Fo47 that we have been working with.

BRAKER combines GeneMark-ETP and AUGUSTUS, two highly accurate gene prediction tools, and can leverage evidence from RNA-Seq data and protein homology to improve annotation quality.

## Configuration and Setup

### Environment Variables

We will set up environment variables for our annotation workflow.

``` bash
export SN=Fo47
export NCPUS=12
export assembly="$PWD/07-repeats-analysis/rm_out/Fo47.fasta.masked"
export proteins="$PWD/08-data/orthodb/Fungi.fa"
export rna_bam="$PWD/08-data/star/${SN}.sorted.bam"
```

### Software Dependencies

We will use the official BRAKER3 container.

#### Apptainer

``` bash
alias braker.pl="apptainer run docker://teambraker/braker3:latest braker.pl"
```

## Annotation Strategy 1: Proteins Only

In this strategy, we will run BRAKER using only protein evidence from our curated Fungi OrthoDB database. This approach is useful when RNA-Seq data is not available or of poor quality.

> **A note on using existing species parameters:** AUGUSTUS comes with pre-trained parameters for many species, including *Fusarium*. While it is possible to use these as a starting point for training, the standard BRAKER workflow is to perform *de novo* training to create a new, highly optimized species model based on the provided evidence. In this tutorial, we will follow the standard workflow. The `--species` parameter in our `braker.pl` command gives a unique name to the new model that BRAKER will create.

``` bash
mkdir -p 09-annot/prot_only

braker.pl \
    --genome=$assembly \
    --prot_seq=$proteins \
    --species=${SN}_prot \
    --workingdir=09-annot/prot_only \
    --threads=$NCPUS \
    --fungus
```

**BRAKER parameters explained:**

-   `--genome`: Path to the repeat-masked genome assembly.
-   `--prot_seq`: Path to the protein database (OrthoDB Fungi).
-   `--species`: A unique name for the species model being trained.
-   `--workingdir`: Directory to store the output files.
-   `--threads`: Number of CPU threads to use.
-   `--fungus`: Specifies to use the fungal branch point model, which is appropriate for our organism.

## Annotation Strategy 2: Proteins + RNA-Seq

Now, we will run BRAKER using both protein and RNA-Seq evidence. This is the recommended approach as it combines homology-based evidence with transcriptomic evidence, leading to more accurate gene predictions.

``` bash
mkdir -p 09-annot/prot_rna

braker.pl \
    --genome=$assembly \
    --prot_seq=$proteins \
    --bam=$rna_bam \
    --species=${SN}_prot_rna \
    --workingdir=09-annot/prot_rna \
    --threads=$NCPUS \
    --fungus
```

**Additional BRAKER parameter:**

-   `--bam`: Path to the sorted BAM file containing aligned RNA-Seq reads.

## Expected Outputs

After running BRAKER, each working directory (`09-annot/prot_only` and `09-annot/prot_rna`) will contain several output files. The most important ones are:

-   `braker.gtf`: The final gene predictions in GTF format.
-   `braker.aa`: The predicted protein sequences in FASTA format.
-   `braker.codingseq`: The predicted coding sequences in FASTA format.
-   `GeneMark-EP/`: Directory containing GeneMark-EP output (for protein-only mode).
-   `GeneMark-ETP/`: Directory containing GeneMark-ETP output (for protein + RNA-Seq mode).
-   `Augustus/`: Directory containing AUGUSTUS output and trained models.

You can compare the results from both strategies to see the impact of adding RNA-Seq evidence on the final gene annotations.
